MAX - Matrix Algebra eXpert, version 12/14/2023.

Overview:

MAX is a user-friendly linear algebra tool implemented in Java that provides functionality for introductory and advanced linear algebra operations. The application supports matrices, vectors, and limited function matrices, offering a variety of operations for each type.

Features:

Matrices
- Row reduction
- Check linear independence
- Transposition
- Matrix invertibility check
- Matrix inversion
- Determinant calculation
- Scalar multiplication
- Matrix multiplication
- Check if matrix spans Rn
- Check orthogonality
- Check orthonormality
- Null space computation
- Row space computation
- Column space computation
- Eigen space computation
- Eigen values calculation

Vectors
- Scalar multiplication
- Multiplication by matrix
- Norm calculation
- Dot product calculation
- Check if vector is in column space
- Check if vector is in row space
- Check if vector is in null space
- Function Matrices (Polynomials)
- Check linear independence
- Check if the matrix spans P2
- Null space computation
- Check orthogonal points in defined inner product space

Function Matrices (Polynomials)
- Check linear independence
- Check if the matrix spans P2
- Null space computation
- Check orthogonal points in defined inner product space

Function Matrices (Functions)
- Check orthogonal points in defined inner product space

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Run the Application class to start MAX.

Usage:
1. Upon launching MAX, you will be prompted to choose between matrices, vectors, or function matrices.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the necessary data for the chosen object.
3. Perform various operations by entering commands such as row reduce, transpose, etc. - type "list" for list of commands.
4. Type "new" to work with new object.
5. Type "stop" at any point to exit the program.
